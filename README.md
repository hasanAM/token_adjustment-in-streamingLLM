Modification 1: Altered Selection of Tokens for Attention
The original method selects the first four tokens for attention.

1. Instead of selecting the first four tokens, we select tokens at intervals. For example, if there are 10 tokens, select tokens 1, 3, 5, 7. If there are 20 tokens and you need to select four, choose tokens 1, 5, 15, 20.

Implement the New Selection:

2. Identify the total number of tokens in the input.

Calculate the intervals based on the total number and the number of tokens to be selected.

Select tokens based on these intervals.

Update the Attention Mechanism:

Modify the attention mechanism to use the newly selected tokens.


Compare the results with the original method to assess the impact of the change.

Modification 2: Incorporating a Keyword Extraction Model
Implement a Keyword Extraction Model:

Developed a model that can extract the most important words from a sentence.

Integrate Keyword Extraction into the Attention Mechanism:

Use the keyword extraction model to identify the top N keywords in each sentence.

Modify the attention mechanism to compute attention scores between all tokens and these keywords.

Adjust the Attention Scores:

Ensure that the attention scores reflect the importance of the keywords.

Test different configurations (e.g., different numbers of keywords) to find the most effective setup.
